# simple-bosh-release
This is a very basic bosh release that delivers a simple ruby file. 
## Approach taken
The following document outlines the approach I took in creating my own release.
I started out reading https://bosh.io/docs/create-release.html. This was really good, as the creation of the release was on going, but not for my first read. [This](http://www.starkandwayne.com/blog/your-first-bosh-release/) blog by Starke and Wayne 
provided the right level of information on how to proceed. 

However, the best link was cloud foundry's [bosh-lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite) documentation. 
## Steps followed
### Preparing the release
1. Install latest version of bosh_cli `gem install bosh_cli --no-ri --no-rdoc`

2. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/)

3. Downloaded [my virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
3.1 Install version 5.1


4. Clone bosh-lite

 ```
 cd ~/workspace
 $ git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite
 $ cd bosh-lite
 ```

5. Start Vagrant. 
`bin/add-route$ vagrant up --provider=virtualbox`

6. Target the BOSH Director. When prompted to log in, use admin/admin.
```
# if behind a proxy, exclude both the VM's private IP and xip.io by setting no_proxy (xip.io is introduced later)
$ export no_proxy=xip.io,192.168.50.4

$ bosh target 192.168.50.4 lite
Target set to `Bosh Lite Director'
Your username: admin
Enter password: *****
Logged in as `admin' 
```

7. Add a set of route entries to your local route table to enable direct Warden container
 access every time your networking gets reset (e.g. reboot or connect to a different network) use `bin/add-route`.

### Creating the release.
1. From my github workspace, I ran `bosh init release simple-bosh-release`

### Add content to source directory.
1. I have 2 Java classes, Send.java and Recieved.java from the rabbitmq example.
2. I have also included rabbitmq-server-generic-unix-3.6.6.tar.xz which will be copied over to vm and installed. 

### Generate Job Skeletons
1. Run the following command `bosh generate job myMessageApp`
2. Update the monit file with start stop commands. 
3. An erb file is created for each job, installing rabbitmq and building the java source and creating the jar file.
4. Create the ctl.erb script to store logs in '/var/vcap/rabbitmq/logs'
5. Updated the spec file to contain a list of the packages, templates and the properties for rabbitmq

### Generate Packaging Scripts
1. Run the following command `bosh generate package SendRecievePackage`
2. Run the following command `bosh generate package rabbitmq`
3. Update the spec for each job, remember SendRecievePackage depends on rabbitmq.
4. Update the package files.

### Add the deployment descriptor
1. Create the release folder.
2. Added the yml file.

### Create a Dev release
1. Run the following command `bosh create release`, add your release name.
2. Find the bosh director `bosh target`
3. Target bosh lite director `bosh target`
